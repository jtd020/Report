# Sparse Graphical Memory (SGM) and Search on the Replay Buffer (SoRB) in PyTorch
## NOTE: This code is a modifed version of the original project as part of a course project. Much of the code and results are somewhat disorganized and it is not intended to be distirbuted. 
## Example usage
```
pip install -e .

python run_PointEnv.py configs/config_PointEnv.py
    or
python run_Custom_Experiments.py configs/config_Rand.py

```
